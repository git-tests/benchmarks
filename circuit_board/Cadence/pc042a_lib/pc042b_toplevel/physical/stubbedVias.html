<b>Note:</b> This report identifies the unused B/B vias associated with a via stack structure. A stack structure can consist of coincidently placed micro, B/B vias or a combination. As an example of what the report detects, consider the stack Micro1-2, BB2-7, Micro7-8; if a trace connects to the stack on Layers 3 and 6, Micro1-2 and Micro7-8 would be identified as "unused".

Firmware for AIDA miniTLU
-------------------------

Needs "IPBus" to communuicate via Ethernet to host.

To build firmware

Check out AIDA mTLU firmware from OHWR:

http://svn.ohwr.org/fmc-mtlu/trunk/firmware fmc-tlu-mtlu-firmware

Check out IPBus firmware from HEPForge:

svn co http://cactus.hepforge.org/svn/tags/IPbusFirmware_pre_131_RAL IPbusFirmware

Copy ise_project directory ( it will be where all the files produced by the ISE tools will end up ):

cp -r  fmc-tlu-mtlu-firmware/ise_projects/fmc_tlu_top_sp601 .

move into the newly created directory:

cd fmc_tlu_top_sp601

Create some soft links to the IPBus and FMC-TLU directories:

ln -s ../IPbusFirmware_pre_131_RAL/firmware ipbus-firmware
ln -s ../fmc-tlu-mtlu-firmware .

Run setup script to create a directory to store output from CoreGen

./setup_ipcore_dir.sh

Run ise

The messages about missing IPCores need to be solved by:

Start the core generator GUI from the Tools menu. Double check that coregen has the correct part settings (doesn't always work), and select: 

    'Project' -> 'Regenerate all project IP'

    And then wait a while.

    Exit coregen GUI once done.
